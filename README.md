**Project Overview** 

This project presents a 32-bit Vedic Multiplier based on the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra from Vedic Mathematics.It uses a Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) 
to achieve high-speed and efficient multiplication. The design reduces delay and improves performance compared to conventional multipliers. It is modular, 
scalable, and suitable for use in DSP and arithmetic circuits. 
The project demonstrates the RTL to GDS flow, automating the essential steps in logic synthesis, timing analysis, power estimation, and physical design using a combination of open-source tools.
