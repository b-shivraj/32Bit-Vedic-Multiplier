**Project Overview** 

This project presents a 32-bit Vedic Multiplier based on the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra from Vedic Mathematics.It uses a Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) 
to achieve high-speed and efficient multiplication. The design reduces delay and improves performance compared to conventional multipliers. It is modular, 
scalable, and suitable for use in DSP and arithmetic circuits.
